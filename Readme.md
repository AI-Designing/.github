## 🚧 Current Flagship Project: FreeCAD Automation

We're currently working on automating **FreeCAD** - one of the most popular open-source parametric 3D modelers. Our goal is to create intelligent automation tools that can:

- **Automate repetitive design tasks**
- **Generate parametric models programmatically**
- **Streamline simulation workflows**
- **Create intelligent design assistants**

### 🔧 FreeCAD Automation Features
- Python scripting automation
- Batch processing capabilities
- Intelligent part generation
- Automated assembly workflows
- Integration with external CAE tools
