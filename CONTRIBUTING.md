## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git & GitHub**: Familiarity with version control and collaborative development
- **Python**: Basic to intermediate knowledge (Python 3.8+ recommended)
- **FreeCAD**: Installation and basic usage knowledge (we'll help you learn!)
- **Mechanical Engineering Background**: Helpful but not mandatory - we welcome all skill levels!

### 🛠️ Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository you want to contribute to

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   cd REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```

2. **Install FreeCAD**: Download from [freecad.org](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php)

3. **Set up Python Environment**: Create a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure FreeCAD Python Path**: Add FreeCAD to your Python path

   ```bash
   export FREECAD_PATH="/path/to/freecad"  # Adjust path for your system
   ```

5. **Create Feature Branch**: Always work on a separate branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
   ```

6. **Test Your Setup**: Run the test suite to ensure everything works

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
